# Glo-Bus Max EPS üíπ

Glo-Bus Max EPS is a Chrome extension developed to optimize Earnings Per Share (EPS) in the Glo-Bus simulation by automating and applying the best financial parameter configurations. This extension actively monitors and iterates through financial inputs, recording the highest EPS scores achieved. It includes an easy-to-use interface for controlling optimization and tracking historical scores.

# Only use this extension on the "AC Camera Marketing" and "UAV Drone Marketing" pages.
# This is not a program to guarantee first place for this simulation
### Here are some tips to follow for this specific strategy of high eps
- Under Projected Performance (red box) make sure the left hand side is more than the right (Investors Expect)
- Go all in on R&D (buy all 50k) 
- Try your best to buy back full stock
- keep p/q around industry average. higher is better if it does not affect eps
- always manually try adjusting the values, this program is **NOT** 100% perfect
- Do **NOT** take our a loan
- try not to have negative ending cash, but also not too much since it could've been invested
- coninue both Improved Working Conditions "Cafeteria and On-Site Child Care Facilities for Plant Employees" and "Additional Safety Equipment and Improved Lighting / Ventilation". No for everything else under CSRC Initiatives
- Do not be afraid to have your workers work overtime
  - You will see this in Compensationa nd fciltiies as "Additional Workstations Needed to Avoid Overtime Assembly #". ignore this unless ths brings EPS up.
  
## Features üöÄ
‚ö†Ô∏è = May or may not work. 
- **Automated EPS Optimization**: Tests various input values to find configurations that yield the highest EPS. ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Financial Metrics Tracking**: Monitors EPS, net revenue, profit, cash, image rating, market share, stock price, and return on assets (ROA). ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Persistent Best Score**: Saves the best EPS score and input configuration, allowing users to reapply or reset values. ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Interactive UI**: Simple start/stop controls with delay customization. ‚úÖ

## Technical Overview

The core functionality of **Glo-Bus Max EPS** is driven by several key JavaScript functions working in concert:

1. **EPS Optimization**: The extension tests various inputs and dropdown selections to find the optimal EPS score by iterating through all possible configurations and calculating the resulting EPS.
2. **Metric Verification**: Each potential new EPS score is verified using `verifyComboScore` to ensure that scores are calculated accurately before updating the best score.
3. **Composite Scoring**: To establish the ‚Äúbest‚Äù EPS configuration, the `calculateCompositeScore` function weighs EPS heavily but also considers other financial metrics (profit, cash, etc.) using a weighted system to calculate a composite score.
4. **Chrome Storage**: The extension uses Chrome's `local storage` to save configurations, scores, and settings across browser sessions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Chrome browser with Developer Mode enabled
- Basic familiarity with Chrome extensions and JavaScript

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sankeer28/glo-bus-max-eps.git
   ```
2. **Load as a Chrome Extension**:
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
   - Enable **Developer Mode**.
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder.
3. **Launch the Extension**:
   - Click on the Glo-Bus Max EPS icon.
   - Set a delay to control optimization speed (optional).
   - Start the extension by clicking **Start**.

## Usage

1. **Setting Delay**: Configure the delay in milliseconds to control the optimization loop's frequency.
2. **Start Optimization**: Clicking **Start** begins the input testing process, which continues until **Stop** is clicked.
3. **EPS Display**: The **Best EPS** score and associated configuration are shown in real-time.
4. **Resetting and Reapplying Values**: Users can reset the EPS and reapply the best values with the **Reset** and **Apply Best Values** options, respectively.
